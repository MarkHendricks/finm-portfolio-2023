    "\n",
    "Securities traded:\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM tried to trade on market mispricing and arbitrage, Relative Value and Convergence trades. They go long-short on these arbitrages. Use leverage to trade bigger principal on these small mispricings and try to hedge out their positions via their long-short trades. They primarily used derivatives, in the form of swaps to achieve these positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM was also heavily involved income and credit, and they also have sizeable positions in equities. In all these asset classes, they trade a large number of securities, across global markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM's trading frequency varied according to their strategies. Their largest investment in the form of convergence trades had a long term trading horizon and frequency (weeks or months). They are not trying to arbitrage intraday movements and nor do they make long-term directional bets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness: \n",
    "\n",
    "They are picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer. So, many small wins. They seek small positive returns using leverage and do not bet significantly on any specific events. Have lower skewness than SPY. However, they are susceptible to extreme market events (it was the Russian currency crisis that brought them down).\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasing: \n",
    "\n",
    "Build models to find mispricing and the reason behind the mispricing. Then forecast their P&L on these trades. Their forecast is not better because of better mathematical model (the convergence trade/ relative value theory is not the edge), it is their knowledge of the market.\n",

    "1. Efficient financing: Their edge was on financing and funding, along with their proprietary trading and modelling capabilities.\n",
    "2. Fund Size: They had a larger AUM, meaning they could lever at favorable rates\n",
    "3. Collatralization: Better collatralize these positions. (pay lower haircuts)\n",
    "4. Long-term Horizon: Long term commitment of capital from investors as well as availability of credit line\n",
    "5. Liquidity and Hedging: LTCM has in place many mechanisms to ensure liquidity. They also avoid taking too much default risk or explicit directional bets. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Collateral haircuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "The haircuts go up in a market disruption event leading to unfavorable collateral terms for LTCM in terms of funding a spread trade. For most trades, LTCM obtains 100% financing on a fully collateralized basis. Furthermore, LTCM stress tests the haircuts across its asset classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repo maturity:\n",
    "\n",
    "In an adverse situation, where their credit risk goes up, they wont be able to secure these longer term repos which were favorable to their trades. LTCM goes against the norm by entering into relatively long-maturity repo. While much of it is overnight, LTCM uses contracts that typically have maturity of 6-12 months. Furthermore, LTCM manages their aggregate repo maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equity redemption:\n",
    "\n",
    "If in a convergence trade, the two securities, before converging, diverge a lot, LTCM are facing redemption risk from their investors at a time where the Margin calls need them to furhter finance their strategies. Equity Redemption at a unfavorable time also leads LTCM to unwind their positions at unfavorable rates leading to further losses of capital. The firm is highly levered, so equity funding risk is especially important. LTCM restricts redemptions of equity year by year. The restriction is particularly strong in that unredeemed money is re-locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan access:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loan access can be tough to come by in times of a crisis, leading to a further decline in the fund's performance. For debt funding, LTCM negotiated a revolving loan that has no Material Adverse Change clause. Thus, the availability of debt funding is not so highly correlated with fund performance. \n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.4\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM required counterparties to maitain the collateral balance via a 'two-way mark to market process on a daily basis. Thus the cash flow coming in from the counterparties mark to market would fund LTCM's outflow for the mark to market call on their offsetting position.\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM als also estimated theoretical worst case haircuts it would face in adverse market situations. Forecasting these worst case liquidity LTCM was able to better structure its financing so as not to liquidate its positions solely due to these adverse market events.\n",
    "\n",
    "LTCM attempts to account for liquidity risk quantitatively by adjusting security correlations. For short-term horizons, LTCM assumes positive correlation between all trade cat- egories. Even if their net exposure to a strategy flips sides, they still assume positive correlation to the new net position\n",
    "\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>\n",
    "Currently since there were no extreme market events, leverage risk is not a concern, but still a potential threat for LTCM. Given the size of their commited capital and fewer opportunites for the excess capital to enhance LTCM's return, they are considering returning some of the investments made, which would reduce the leverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the amount of \"true\" leverage is also frequently misreported. The reason being that SEC filings require the reporting of the gross notional exposure, not the net exposure! As an example, consider [this article](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/investing/michael-burry-stock-market-crash/index.html). It claims that Michael Burry \"bet\" $1.6 billion on a market crash. In reality, his exposure is $1.6 billion; he achieved this by buying put options for much, much, cheaper (potentially as low as ~$10m in premiums; capping his losses at $10m).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>\n",
    "\n",
    "About a year after the time of the case, the fund loses most of its value due to non-converging trades. So clearly there is some risk!\n",
    "\n",
    "Positions are subject to liquidity risk. If market liquidity dries up or the markets become segmented, the divergent spreads can persist for a long time. This indeed happens later to LTCM. The trades that get them in trouble ultimately pay off, but not before LTCM blew up. LTCM believed it can exit these convergence trades if they become too unprofitable. However, a stop-loss order is not the same as a put option. If the price jumps discontinuously through the stop-loss, then it is ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a market may be paralyzed/illiquid when trying to execute the stop-loss. A put option does not need to worry about price impact, whereas a stop-loss does. Finally, a stop-loss ensures that an investor sells as soon as a security price hits a worst-case scenario, ensuring unfavorable market timing.\n",
