    "HMC employs a two-stage optimization method: first, they optimize individual asset class portfolios, and then they merge them into one overall optimized portfolio. To ensure this approach approximates full Mean-Variance (MV) optimization effectively, it's crucial that there are minimal cross-asset covariance variations among individual securities within different asset classes. Essentially, if covariances between securities in different asset class buckets remain stable, the omission of considering diversification between them becomes less significant in this approximation.\n",

    "The argument for TIPS can go either way. In the argument to keep it separate, there is more diversification between TIPS and bonds than between SPY and many other equity buckets Harvard has.

    "HMC prioritizes real returns over nominal returns in portfolio analysis because real returns account for inflation, providing a more accurate measure of purchasing power and true investment performance. Using real returns instead of nominal returns is not just a matter of scaling; it can potentially alter the MV optimization solution. MV optimization relies on expected returns and risk, typically measured by the variance of returns, to determine the optimal portfolio allocation. Since inflation affects real returns, using nominal returns in the optimization would fail to account for the eroding effect of inflation on the portfolio's purchasing power. This could lead to suboptimal investment decisions, as the optimization might recommend a higher allocation to assets with higher nominal returns, even if they do not necessarily result in better real returns after accounting for inflation.\n",

This signifies a nearly 10% decline in optimization performance when transitioning from Exhibit 5 to Exhibit 6 due to increased constraints. An unconstrained solution would yield a Mean/Volatility Ratio exceeding 0.80. For expected return targets further from the tangency point, this decline in performance worsens as the MV-efficient portfolios cannot be attained through appropriate short positions.\n"

    "\n",
    "* Dropping TIPS from the investment set barely impacts the weights or the resulting performance.\n",
    "* Adjusting the mean of TIPS upward even just 1 standard error substantially impacts the allocations and moderately boosts the resulting performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on just a mean-variance analysis, it seems one could reasonably go either way with TIPS as an alternate asset class. In the argument to keep it separate, there is more diversification between TIPS and bonds than between SPY and many other equity buckets Harvard has. On the other hand, TIPS mostly impact the allocation to domestic bonds and might be seen as another asset in that bucket."
