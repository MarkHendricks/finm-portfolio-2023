For example, we saw in C.1 -- [link](https://github.com/MarkHendricks/finm-portfolio-2023/blob/main/discussions/C.1.%20Harvard%20Endowment.ipynb) -- that just a 0.0012 change in monthly returns for TIPs leads to a large change in tangency portfolio weights.\n",

    "Regularization helps with this issue as it makes the covariance matrix more stable, specifically by making is less singular. This is because we are (for example in HW1), taking the average of the observed covariance matrix with the diagonalized one. This shrinks the off-diagonal elements, which makes the matrix less singular, and thus more stable when we invert it -- leading to more stable tangency portfolio weights.
